        <div class="question">
          How long does it take for my order to arrive?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The delivery time depends on the shipping method you choose and your
          location. Some online stores offer expedited shipping for an
          additional fee. Check the estimated delivery time on the website
          before you place your order.

        <div class="question">
          What if I change my mind after I've made a purchase?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Most online stores have a return and refund policy that allows you to
          return items for a refund or exchange. However, you should check the
          website's policy before making a purchase, as some items may be
          non-returnable or subject to restocking fees.

        <div class="question">How can I track my order?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Most online stores provide a tracking number once your order has been
          shipped. You can use this tracking number to monitor the delivery
          status of your order. You can usually find the tracking number in your
          account or in the confirmation email you received when you placed your
          order.

        <div class="question">
          How do I know if an online store is offering a good deal or a sale?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          You can compare the prices of the products you want to buy on
          different websites to see if the deal is actually a good one. You can
          also check the original price of the product and compare it to the
          discounted price to see if it's worth it. Additionally, you can sign
          up for email newsletters or follow the store on social media to get
          updates on their latest deals and promotions.

        <div class="question">Can I cancel my order after I've placed it?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Most online stores allow you to cancel your order within a certain
          timeframe, usually within a few hours or up to 24 hours after placing
          the order. However, some stores may not allow cancellations or may
          charge a fee for cancellations. You should check the store's
          cancellation policy before making a purchase.
